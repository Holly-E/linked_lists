Practicing Linked Lists in JS

Linked Lists have Big O Notation of O (1) for adding / removing a head and tail, and O (n) for searching. (Fast at storing a node and ok but not the best at searching.) They have a memory management benefit that the data in a linked list does not have to be stored in one place and can be stored in separate chunks, as each node will point to the next node. As a result, Linked Lists are good for storing large amounts of data that don't need to be accessed regularly, such as archiving tweets.
